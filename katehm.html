		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Kateh, pronounced like kay-tuh with a soft T. I grew up for a time in Belgium where I received my nickname from my best friends in middle school there, and it has followed me into adulthood. Art is my passion, and design is my jam. I’m not a big fan of coding but I keep landing web contracts so I have to keep up. Some of my favourite games are Dragon Age, Child of Light, Spyro, Pokemon, Journey, Witcher, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Undertale. I moved to Vancouver for a couple of years to work in the video games industry but moved back to Ontario after the Vancouver housing market priced me out. Maybe I’ll try Montreal next.</p>

		<h2>The Professional</h2>
		<p>I secured my advanced graphic design diploma from Fanshawe College in 2014. For the last 4 years, I have freelanced as a graphic designer, web developer, digital illustrator, and game artist. Some of the highlights in my freelancing career has been <a href=“http://www.babydriver-movie.com/discanddigital/”>developing the Blu-ray & Digital launch website for Sony’s Baby Driver</a>, as well as releasing my first indie game title, <a href=“https://store.steampowered.com/app/453910/Love_is_Dead/“>Love is Dead</a>. I worked as art director, concept artist, and 2D asset artist on Love is Dead, now available on Steam for PC & Mac.</p>
		<p>I hope to fill in the gaps in my education with the interactive media design program, and I am particularly looking forward to learning programming languages outside of HTML/CSS, as well as motion graphics and UI/UX design. My gap in education in these three subjects has cost me either additional costs to outsource programmers, or lost opportunities to work on projects requiring knowledge in animation and UI/UX design in the video game industry.</p>

        <h2>About Yoon</h2>
        <p>Soyoon Lee goes by the nickname Yoon and she's from Seoul, Korea. She is sweet and shy but isn't afraid to ask for help if she needs it, which is a skill that took me a long time to learn.</p>
